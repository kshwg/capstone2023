# Introduction
Schoolient is a platform providing scholarships by essay and non-essay. The word Schoolient itself stands for School and Resilient. Here applicants can create an account first before they apply for the scholarship. Since the scholarship is an essay, then you only have to submit your essay or a pdf. Moreover, there is no need for any document such as a recommendation letter, as long as you are met the qualification, then you are eligible to register.
